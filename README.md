📝 Project Description

💡 Inspiration  
University campuses often face issues with disconnected systems, slow service responses, and repetitive manual queries. Students struggle to find course details, book appointments, or locate staff quickly.  
Our inspiration was to create a **unified AI assistant** that brings together all campus-related services into one intelligent, accessible, and easy-to-use system.

⚙️ What It Does  
SmartCampus is an AI-powered web platform that simplifies campus life by providing:  
- AI Chatbot: Answers natural-language questions about courses, professors, and events.  
- Appointment Scheduler: Helps students book and manage meetings with faculty.  
- Campus Navigation: Provides directions to buildings, labs, and offices.  
- Service Requests: Lets users submit and track administrative or maintenance requests.  
- Feedback System:Collects student input to improve services.  
- Admin Dashboard: Allows staff to manage, monitor, and analyze campus queries.

It acts as a 24/7 virtual helpdesk, reducing the workload on administrative departments while improving accessibility and response time.

🏗️ How We Built It  
The system was built using a modular architecture for scalability and maintainability.  

Technologies Used: 
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, Tailwind (for responsive UI)  
- Backend:FastAPI (Python)  
- Database:MongoDB  
- AI/NLP:LLM + Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for context-based responses  
- Environment:Docker (for containerized local deployment)  
- Version Control: GitHub  

Each module (Chatbot, Appointment System, and Admin Dashboard) interacts with the backend through secure APIs. The chatbot uses LLM + RAG to fetch relevant answers from the structured campus knowledge base.

🚧 Challenges We Faced  
- Structuring unorganized campus data for accurate AI retrieval.  
- Ensuring chatbot context-awareness and minimizing irrelevant responses.  
- Managing frontend responsiveness for multiple screen sizes.  
- Integrating multiple systems (chat, booking, feedback) without performance lag.  
- Maintaining data security and preventing overlapping service requests.

---

🧠 Lessons Learned  
- How to combine AI and backend systems effectively for real-world applications.  
- The importance of data structuring and prompt design in retrieval-based AI.  
- Implementing and debugging APIs with FastAPI and MongoDB.  
- Designing user-centric interfaces for both students and staff.  
- Using version control and collaboration tools efficiently within a team.

---

🚀 Future Plans / Next Steps  
- Integrate **voice-based interaction** for hands-free accessibility.  
- Expand chatbot knowledge base to include clubs, events, and library data.  
- Build a **mobile version** using Flutter or React Native.  
- Introduce **multi-language support** for international campuses.  
- Deploy on **university-managed servers or private cloud infrastructure** for real use.
